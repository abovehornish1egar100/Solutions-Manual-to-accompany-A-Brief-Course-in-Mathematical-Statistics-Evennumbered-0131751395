Author: Robert V. Hogg, Elliot A. Tanis

This innovative new introduction to Mathematical Statistics covers the important concept of estimation at a point much earlier (Chapter 2) than others on this subject. Applies mathematical statistics to topics such as insurance, Pap smear tests, estimating the number of whales in an ocean, fitting models, filling 12 ounce containers, environmental issues, and results in certain sporting events. Includes summaries of the most important aspects of discrete distributions, continuous distributions, confidence intervals, and tests of hypotheses. Provides computer applications for data analysis and also for theoretical solutions such as simulation and bootstrapping. A comprehensive reference for individuals who need to brush up on their knowledge of statistics.
